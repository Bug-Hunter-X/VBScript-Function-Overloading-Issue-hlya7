This example demonstrates a common error in VBScript stemming from the lack of function overloading. The initial intention might be to create a function that behaves differently based on the number of arguments, but VBScript's behavior results in the last defined version overriding the others. The solution offers a workaround using optional parameters and conditional logic to achieve similar functionality.
